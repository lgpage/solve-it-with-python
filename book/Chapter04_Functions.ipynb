    "## Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important skills you will acquire is debugging. Although it can be frustrating, debugging is one of the most intellectually rich, challenging, and interesting parts of programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some ways debugging is like detective work. You are confronted with clues and you have to infer the processes and events that led to the results you see.\n",
    "\n",
    "Debugging is also like an experimental science. Once you have an idea about what is going wrong, you modify your program and try again. If your hypothesis was correct, you can predict the result of the modification, and you take a step closer to a working program. If your hypothesis was wrong, you have to come up with a new one. As Sherlock Holmes pointed out, “When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.” (A. Conan Doyle, The Sign of Four)\n",
    "\n",
    "For some people, programming and debugging are the same thing. That is, programming is the process of gradually debugging a program until it does what you want. The idea is that you should start with a working program and make small modifications, debugging them as you go.\n",
    "\n",
    "Breaking a large program into smaller functions creates natural checkpoints for debugging. If a function is not working, there are three possibilities to consider:\n",
    "- There is something wrong with the arguments the function is getting; a precondition is violated.\n",
    "- There is something wrong with the function; a postcondition is violated.\n",
    "- There is something wrong with the return object or the way it is being used.\n",
    "\n",
    "To rule out the first possibility, you can add a print statement at the beginning of the function and display the values of the parameters (and maybe their types). Or you can write code that checks the preconditions explicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the parameters look good, add a print statement before each return statement and display the return object. If possible, check the result by hand. Consider calling the function with values that make it easy to check the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the function seems to be working, look at the function call to make sure the return object is being used correctly (or used at all!).\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding print statements at the beginning and end of a function can help make the flow of execution more visible. It takes some time to develop effective scaffolding, but a little bit of scaffolding can save a lot of debugging."
