    "In the previous section we had an example where a few terms in the Taylor series for $e^x$ produced a very accurate approximation, whereas approximation to $\\pi$ of the 1000$^\\textrm{th}$ term was still inaccurate. So how can we tell in advance how many terms will be required to get an accurate function value? We can't. The only benefit of using the `for` statement to compute the approximate value to a function is its simplicity. In general, our goal would be to compute an accurate function value rather than just add some predetermined number of terms. So how should we approach the problem of computing an accurate function value using a Taylor series approximation?\n",
