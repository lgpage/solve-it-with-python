Solve It With Python
====================

Notebooks for Solve It With Python, by Logan Page, Schalk Kok, Nico Wilke, and
Others

Why do it by hand when you can solve it with Python?

These Notebooks are intended to be viewed through
[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) which can be installed through
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/downloads). This book also makes use of the
Notebook extension [nbtutor](https://github.com/lgpage/nbtutor) for visualizing
code execution (line-by-line) in Notebook cells.
